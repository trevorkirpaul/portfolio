      <p class="aboutPara" >
        I've always had an appreciation for design. In normal, everday life, I'll spot something beautiful and inspiring. This could be anything from the logos of various JavaScript framerworks to the package design for granola at the grocery store.
      </p>
      
      <p class="aboutPara" >
        I love creating basically anything. The process itself is rewarding but respecting all the tiny details that go into it is a whole different level. I seriously started learning modern web development earlier this year. Before this, I was accustomed to web design from my high school days. I attended a school that was focuced on art and technology so I had a great community to build up a decent foundation.
      </p>
      
      <p class="aboutPara" >
        Regardless of what I once thought, seeing the modern process was eye-opening. JavaScript had become much more powerful and the entire wasy a web site was served seemed almost alien. For me, having so many options and a process that had so many tools wasn't daunting. It was amazing.
      </p>
      
      <p class="aboutPara" >
        I loved the different logos for frameworks. Even the names sounded cool. React, Redux, Node...the names and logos were almost like products that I wanted to own and play with.

          I definitely care about living comfortable but I what I know is that I want to be a professional web developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until previously, when I was working as a bartender, I was preparing to make a switch to a career dealing with computers. I didn't know much about the specifics but I wanted to study for things like the A+ exam and eventually build a few home servers. I wanted to get into networking.      
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I made a rough outline of my plans although it was more like a wishlist of what I want to do. One of the main points was that I eventually wanted to make my own company that focused on web and graphic design. This was my dream. My true wish was to become a web developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to when I decided to become a programmer. All my life I knew I had the ability to at learn learn how to code. I took a few programming classes in school and I always look back on that time fondly. I'm also always very crucial about tiny details in a game I play or a program I use.
        </p>

          So I started learning JavaScript. It was amazing and I loved the tiny programs I made. I also loved the fact that I actually used Sublime Text. I had downloaded that editor years ago and I thought the syntax highlighting was the coolest thing. Finally I was actually using it and I loved every minute of it. Even the tools themselves and customizing them is a facet of the profession that I enjoy. It's like a car aficionado with after market parts.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutSpecial" >
          Even though it may sound like this is my new hobby, I want to stress how much time I spend learning. Learning to become a better web developer is an everyday thing for me. I literally spend every single day either watching a dev related youtube video, reading a blog post, browsing the many sub-reddits concerning web dev, on discord's JavaScript channels and most importantly actual coding. The best thing is that it's fun for me. Even though I barely take a break, I have honestly enjoyed it and this has been and will continue to be a very rewarding experience.
