# My Portolio Web Site

This is my second attempt at design my portfolio. I actually learned a lot about media queries with SASS and keeping my .sass file organzed (at least a little more organized).

I'm also just using flexbox and it's honestly my first time using it. I have to admit it's a lot easier that grid and that's mainly because my design just needs flexbox.

This design is simple and beautiful and I think this will be the direction I take for deployment.

The mobile view's menu button has its js functionality now. I still need to add animation to the button and mobile menu pane as well as the rest of the site. This will be my first time dealing with animation so it should prove to be a great learning experience.

The footer and asmall contact form has been designed and implemented on the front page. I'm trying to figure out how I want the form to operate.
