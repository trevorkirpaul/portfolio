# My Portolio Web Site

This is my second attempt at design my portfolio. I actually learned a lot about media queries with SASS and keeping my .sass file organzed (at least a little more organized).

I'm also just using flexbox and it's honestly my first time using it. I have to admit it's a lot easier that grid and that's mainly because my design just needs flexbox.

This design is simple and beautiful and I think this will be the direction I take for deployment.
